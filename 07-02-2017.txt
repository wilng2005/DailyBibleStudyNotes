Leviticus 1 {
	- Sacrificing a lamb for burnt offering
	
}

Leviticus 2 {
	- Grain offering{
		- needs to offer salt
	}
}

Leviticus 3 {

Matthew 24 {
	- There will be many false christs{
		- Wherever the corpse is, the vultures will
		  gather (Matt 24:28)
	}
	
	- When the real Son of Man arrives, it will be 
	  quite epic {
		- all the tribes will mourn
		- they will see Him coming with great
		  power and glory
		- send out angels
		- gather His elect
	}

	- Lesson of the fig tree {
		- be ready!
	}

	- No one knows {
		- Even Jesus doesn't know, so if anyone
		  claims to know, he probably is lying
		  and also doesn't know Jesus
		- Some will be taken, some will not be
		- Be ready, or you will be punished.
	}
}

Lesson {
	- be willing to offer up yourself to make
	  restitution with God, and your neighbour
	- Don't be delude by false salvation, real 
	  salvation is epic
	- Be ready for Jesus to really return.
